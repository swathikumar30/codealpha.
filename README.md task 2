Problem Statement:
   Businesses invest heavily in advertising across various platforms and customer segments, but often lack accurate forecasting models to predict how these investments will impact sales. There is a need to build a predictive model that can estimate future sales based on variables like advertising spend, platform type (TV, Radio, Online), and target segment (age group, income bracket, etc.). 
 
Objective:
   Predict future sales using regression and time series techniques.
   Understand the effect of different advertising channels on sales outcomes.
   Deliver actionable insights to support data-driven marketing and budgeting decisions.

Project Summary:
   In this project, we use Python and machine learning techniques to predict sales figures based on advertising expenditures and demographic factors. The project involves thorough data preprocessing, regression modeling (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost), and evaluation of model performance. We also explore how changes in advertising strategy influence sales trends, helping businesses make informed marketing decisions.

Project Description:
   1. Data Collection:
     Dataset includes historical sales, advertising spend (TV, Radio, Social Media, Online), target demographic, platform, and time variables (month/year).
     Public datasets like the "Advertising.csv" or real business datasets can be used.
   2. Data Preprocessing:
     Handling missing/null values.
     Encoding categorical variables (e.g., segment, platform).
     Normalization/standardization.
     Feature selection (correlation matrix, variance threshold).
   3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
     Sales trends over time.
     Relationship between spend and sales.
     Channel-wise contribution to sales.
   4. Model Building:
     Linear Regression to capture linear relationships.
     random Forest / XGBoost for non-linear patterns.
     Time Series models (ARIMA, Prophet) if temporal patterns are dominant.
   5. Model Evaluation:
     Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R² Score.
     Residual plots, feature importance
   6. Scenario Analysis:
     simulate increase/decrease in advertising spend.
     Compare predicted outcomes across different platforms or target segments.
 
Key Project Details:
     Component	Details
     Programming Language	Python
     Libraries Used	Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Prophet (optional)
     ML Models	Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, ARIMA/Prophet
     Target Variable	Sales
     Input Features	Advertising Spend, Platform, Segment, Time

Results:
     Achieved R² score of 0.85 using XGBoost model.
     Found that TV and Online ads have the strongest correlation with sales.
     Time series trends show seasonal spikes during festival months.
     A 20% increase in Online advertising led to a predicted 12% boost in sales.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can be effectively used to forecast sales and optimize marketing budgets. By analyzing past trends and modeling relationships between advertising and sales, businesses can enhance their decision-making and ROI. Future work can include deeper personalization based on customer behavior and integrating real-time campaign performance.
