🧩 Problem Statement:

Classify iris flowers into one of the three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — based on their sepal and petal dimensions using machine learning.

🎯 Objective:

To build a supervised machine learning classification model using the Scikit-learn inbuilt Iris dataset.

To understand and implement basic concepts of classification in machine learning.

To evaluate the model performance using standard metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

📌 Project Summary:

In this project, we developed a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers based on their physical characteristics. Using the well-known Iris dataset, we trained a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier and evaluated its performance. This project demonstrates essential machine learning steps: data preprocessing, model training, testing, evaluation, and visualization.
